# RiskyDE

This is the public repository for TGnF's RiskyDE (where "DE" stands for "Desktop Environment").

RiskyDE is an HTML-based desktop environment. I created it to satisfy my desire of designing a vintage GUI.
That being said, I am not known for developing GUIs... Your experience may vary.

If you'd like to give it a try, follow [this link.](https://jjwright995.github.io/RiskyDE/)

Enjoy!
